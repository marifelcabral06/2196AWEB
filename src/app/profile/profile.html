  <h2 class="section-title">PERSONAL PROFILE</h2>
  <p class="profile-text">
    I am a third-year undergraduate student specializing in Web Development with knowledge in both frontend
    and backend technologies. I have worked with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am familiar with frameworks
    such as Vue.js and beginner-level Angular. I also have experience in backend development using Express.js
    and database management with MySQL and MongoDB. For design, I use Figma to create simple and user-friendly
    interfaces. In addition, I have basic networking knowledge through Cisco Packet Tracer. Through academic
    and group projects, I have strengthened my problem-solving skills and enjoy collaborating with others.
    I am motivated to keep learning and contribute to projects that improve digital experiences.

    My objective is to keep developing my technical skills, investigate contemporary frameworks and cloud platforms,
    and participate in initiatives that improve digital performance and usability. My goal is to become a full-stack
    developer that can create, develop, and implement scalable apps while keeping up with new technologies to provide
    creative solutions.
